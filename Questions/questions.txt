100. Why is Node.js Single-threaded?

Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing async processing on a single-thread under typical web loads, more performance and scalability can be achieved instead of the typical thread-based implementation.

101.  If Node.js is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency?

The Multi-Threaded Request/Response Stateless Model is not followed by the Node JS Platform, and it adheres to the Single-Threaded Event Loop Model. The Node JS Processing paradigm is heavily influenced by the JavaScript Event-based model and the JavaScript callback system. As a result, Node.js can easily manage more concurrent client requests. The event loop is the processing model's beating heart in Node.js

102. What is an EventEmitter in Node.js?

EventEmitter is a class that holds all the objects that can emit events
Whenever an object from the EventEmitter class throws an event, all attached functions are called upon synchronously
103. What are the two types of API functions in Node.js?

The two types of API functions in Node.js are:

Asynchronous, non-blocking functions
Synchronous, blocking functions
104. What are the security implementations that are present in Node.js?

One of the most important security features in Node.js is the ability to run code in a restricted environment. This is achieved through the use of a sandboxed environment, which can help prevent malicious code from accessing sensitive data or causing any damage to the system.

Another important security feature in Node.js is using TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit. This can help to prevent eavesdropping and ensure that sensitive data is protected.

105. What is Libuv?

Libuv is a critical component of Node.js, making it possible to handle I/O operations in a non-blocking and efficient manner.

106. What is the use of the connect module in Node.js?

The Connect module can be used to handle different types of middleware, such as error-handling middleware, cookie-parsing middleware, and session middleware. Error-handling middleware is used to handle errors that occur during the request/response cycle. Cookie parsing middleware is used to parse cookies from the request header. Session middleware is used to manage user sessions.
